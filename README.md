# cv-application-react

Need a basic template for your CV Application? 
This project takes your input and displays them on a simple resume template. Although the styles are very modern, the purpose of this project is taking input from 
one component, and passing that information to the template components. The input is gathered from text inputs and checkboxes, put into arrays, then displayed on 
the other components.
